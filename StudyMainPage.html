                  <ul>
                      <li>

                  Data is provided in two forms:
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          <span class="gold">DB:</span>  This form provides both USD and local currency data columns.   It is best for use in pivot tables or loading into other tools that require a database-like structure.  There is one data point per line.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span class="gold">Local:</span>  This form, in your selected currency, is compact, easy to visualize, and best suitable for developing your own charts, tables, reports using Excel formulas.

                      </li>

                  </ul>

                  All datasheets may contain some data that is counts of products.  these are all identified in the "Units" columns in the data sheets.
